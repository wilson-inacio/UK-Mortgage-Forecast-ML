    "# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for Forecasting UK Mortgage Rates\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "UK mortgage rates directly impact affordability, re-financing decisions, and lender risk management. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline that forecasts short-term mortgage rate movements to support decisions such as re-financing timing, product pricing, and risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow from data acquisition to model evaluation and can be converted into a production-ready pipeline."
