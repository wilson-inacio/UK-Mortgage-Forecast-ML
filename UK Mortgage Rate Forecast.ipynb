    "# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for Forecasting UK Mortgage Rates\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "UK mortgage rates directly impact affordability, re-financing decisions, and lender risk management. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline that forecasts short-term mortgage rate movements to support decisions such as re-financing timing, product pricing, and risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow from data acquisition to model evaluation and can be converted into a production-ready pipeline."

    "An MAE for both variables close to 0.10 means that the model predicts the fixed mortgage rates with an error of up to 0.11 and 0.98 percentage points, the values of RMSE of close to 0.03 indicates that the predictions are very close to the actual, observed data points. Both metrics confirm that the predictions are fairly accurate."
